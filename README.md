# PATCHWORK

### Front End (React) for Java + Spring Tutorial

#### [Patchwork Back End](https://github.com/themarkfullton/patchwork-back-end) (Java + Spring; MongoDB)

Full Stack. Virtual Pet game meets Frankenstein. Create your own doll companions and fight a faceless evil. Still under construction, but you can still create, edit, and delete "patches" (pets).

Threw this together to show a student how a Java + Spring backend would work. (In comparison to MERN.)

Backend for an adoptables / pet website where users can build their own Frankenstein "monsters."
